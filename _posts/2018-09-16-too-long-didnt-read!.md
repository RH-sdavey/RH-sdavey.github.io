This is an excellent open source tool that has clients for many languages, python and bash included, and even online support.
The description I created a loooong tme ago is written below but essentially its a replacement of the sometimes overly-verbose man pages.
By typing "tldr <some_command>" you are given the top 5-10 uses of that command from its own page. Usually the usage you need 
is included in the output and it saves a lot of scrolling through man pages for a particular usage.

I personally contributed a few new pages to this tool, and many code review comments. They are a great, friendly open source community, 
but highly professional and take pride in keeping high standards in their code.
My description follows...
Enjoy!

Ever wondered what the flags were for that command you used last year sometime at 3am when you were in the middle of patching
some server and needed to inversely grep some text file, save the results in a root-owned text file, before zipping it with maximum
compression and then scp'ing it to your backup server?

wonder no more! tldr ( too long didnt read ) to the rescue!

Ever tried, in a moment of pure insanity to actually, genuinely and somewhat..naively read and truly understand the linux man page for
bash, ssh, tar..etc? 

Try no more! tldr ( too long didnt read ) to the rescue!

check out this repo...
https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr

there are many ways to install the application, ( there is even a web-app version available for your browser), 

so...tell me right now which command to run to archive a directory recursively and split the output zip files into 1gb files each, (for uploading for example) 

Tram-da-da-daaaaa....

follow the example, and you are gooooood to go my friend!
And thats that.
