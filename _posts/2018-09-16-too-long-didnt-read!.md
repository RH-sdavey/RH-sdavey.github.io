Ever wondered what the flags were for that command you used last year sometime at 3am when you were in the middle of patching
some server and needed to inversely grep some text file, save the results in a root-owned text file, before zipping it with maximum
compression and then scp'ing it to your backup server?

wonder no more! tldr ( too long didnt read ) to the rescue!

Ever tried, in a moment of pure insanity to actually, genuinely and somewhat..naively read and truly understand the linux man page for
bash, ssh, tar..etc? 

Try no more! tldr ( too long didnt read ) to the rescue!

check out this repo...
https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr

there are many ways to install the application, ( there is even a web-app version available for your browser), personally I have 
found a few bugs/inconsistencies in the bash native client, so Im currently using the python client, with no ( so far ) side effects..
I just aliased the tldr.py command to 'tldr' and it work the exact same as the bash client.

so...tell me right now which command to run to archive a directory recursively and split the output zip files into 1gb files each, (for uploading for example) 

Tram-da-da-daaaaa....

follow the example, and you are gooooood to go my friend!
And thats that.
