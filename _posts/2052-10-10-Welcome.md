## Hello and welcome! 

I started this website as a personal blog, but, as with 99% of blogs created online, I quickly gave up.

So now I keep it as a history of open source projects/scripts/apps or websites I have worked on, and theres a list of learning resources if you are interested.

Its work in progress, and I would like to create a post for each "project" but incase I dont, heres what you can do to have a quick explore so far...
