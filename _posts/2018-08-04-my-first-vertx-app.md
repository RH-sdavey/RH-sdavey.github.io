Today I create my first vertx application,[1] 

#### "Eclipse Vert.x is a tool-kit for building reactive applications on the JVM."

In English, and for my purpose this means that its a toolkit that enabled me to create an http server, hosting a very simple website ( which will be improved very soon  ) and accept API requests to that server, so I can start parsing information from there once more info has been added ( data can be added either by cUrl requests or through the webui ). 

The website has a mongo-db attached which means the data is persistent across server restarts. ( Something I never knew how to do before today ) 

The whole thing is written in java, and while I didnt understand every single line of the tutorial, I would happily reccomend it to anyone who wishes to learn how to do the same. 

This is the link [https://vertx.io/blog/my-first-vert-x-3-application/](https://vertx.io/blog/my-first-vert-x-3-application/) , its a 6 part series with hopefully more to come, the author seems to have other vertx tutorials available on his gh repo. [https://github.com/cescoffier](https://github.com/cescoffier) which I will follow as soon as possible.
