Here's a few links I've put together recently that will really help anyone who wants to/needs to learn git, quickly!
(maybe these will also be added to the links section of my site, but for now... they're here, because they are truly essential and not just not "part of the many". if you wanna learn git... or improve on your 1yr <  skills, look no further) 

* https://learngitbranching.js.org/
* https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git
* https://gitexercises.fracz.com/
* https://try.github.io/
* https://ohshitgit.com/

I'm sure many more links should be added here, but as I say, if you want to level up very very quickly, I reccomend these links, and then you will surely be able to understand this link, which is *the* resource for git ( this _is_ in my links section )
