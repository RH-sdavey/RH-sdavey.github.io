Well, I thought long and hard about what to put on this last page of my blog, and I came to the conclusion... I must put 
all the music I discover here, just to share it, with somebody, anybody.
The only thing I wish to share here, for you to learn about me, is the breadth, the depth and the range of music I enjoy.\I have no limits, I have no "off-limits", bring it on!
