 - Live in or around the Brno, CZ area?
 
 I can help you!
 
 I offer a service to change your Windows computer to Linux. What does it mean? Is it scary? Why am I offering this service, read on..
 
  - What does it mean?
    - 
     For the complete beginner, it can be said very simply... Your current computer has Microsoft Windows, which after some time becomes very "heavy" on your computer, taking up more and more resources and eventually slowing down your computer to a frustrating and unusable condition, it takes a long time to load any application and often crashes with the terrible "blue screen of death". This can be very annoying for all users, young and old, as younger users expect computers to run fast and perfectly, and older users can get confused with waiting for a slow loading computer. I will change your computer to a new "version" of Windows called Linux. It will look and feel the same as Windows and will work 99% the same way as your old Windows computer did. However, it will be fast, as if it were brand new from the shop, it will load any application in seconds rather than minutes, it will boot from power off to ready to use in 1/5th of the time as previously,it will update itself with no annoying popups or blocking to your screen ( in the background ), and no restart required. AND, no blue screen of death or viruses, ever!
     
     There are many versions of Linux available, I believe all are useful in different ways, they are all* free ( so called "open-source" ) and have free software and updates available
