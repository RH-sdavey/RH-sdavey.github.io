 - Not scared to try new things?
 - Got a new laptop and want to use your old one for learning, or wish to try and rescue it?
 - Live in or around the Brno, CZ area?
 
 I can help you!
 
 I offer a service to change your Windows computer to Linux. What does it mean? Is it scary? Why am I offering this service, read on..
 
  - What does it mean?
    - 
     - For the complete beginner, it can be said very simply... Your current computer has Microsoft Windows, which after some time becomes very "heavy" on your computer, taking up more and more resources and eventually slowing down your computer to a frustrating and unusable condition, it takes a long time to load any application and often crashes with the terrible "blue screen of death".
     - This can be very annoying for all users, young and old, as younger users expect computers to run fast and perfectly, and older users can get confused with waiting for a slow loading computer. Many people will throw the laptop to the trash, thinking it is "broken" or "beyone repair", a waste of money!
     - I will change your computer to a new "version" of Windows called Linux. It will look and feel the same as Windows and will work 99% the same way as your old Windows computer did. However, it will be fast, as if it were brand new from the shop, it will load any application in seconds rather than minutes, it will boot from power off to ready to use in 1/5th of the time as previously, it will update itself with no annoying popups or blocking to your screen ( in the background ), and no restart required. AND, no blue screen of death or viruses, ever!
     - There are many versions of Linux available, I believe all are useful in different ways, they are all* free ( so called "open-source" ) and have free software and updates available 
    ![linux updates](http://www.stickycomics.com/wp-content/uploads/update_for_your_computer.jpg "Linux updates")   
    - For *really really* old computers, I would likely install "Linux Mint" which is very similar to Windows, but very light on your computer, taking almost no resources, and very easy to update or customise. 
    - For *really* old computers, I would likely install Ubuntu/Fedora depending on your preference/ability. Both can be customised to look and feel exactly like Windows, and will work so fast on your computer, you will feel like its brand new!
    - For those who just want a change... you can have any version of Linux you choose, I can talk with you abou the pro's/con's of each version
    - I can install a free and open source of almost any application you normally use on Windows, There are many thousands, even millions of free downloads available as alternatives to Windows applications. 
    - I will provide you with a fully comprehensive help file, explaining all features of your new computer, and what to do if something goes wrong ( my contact details  and personal chat room for after-care will always be available )
    
  - Is it scary?
    - 
     - no!
