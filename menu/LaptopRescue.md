 - Do you have an old, slowing, frustrating laptop that takes *ages* to do anything?
 - reguarly waiting 5+ minutes to load a web browser?
 - Want to escape the "blue screen of death"?
 - Tired of viruses and bugs, windows updates causing you to lose your work?
 - Want to experiment with a linux operating system?
 - Not scared to try new things?
 - Got a new laptop and want to use your old one for learning, or wish to try and rescue it?
 - Live in or around the Brno, CZ area?
 
 I can help you!
