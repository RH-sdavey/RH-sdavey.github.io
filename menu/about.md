Hello, welcome, I'm Sean, nice to meet you!

### A bit about the past

I was born, and mostly, grew up in Batley. Batley is a very small town in West Yorkshire, Northern England.

I attended Batley Grammar School, and the only lessons I enjoyed were Sports and Computing.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batley_Grammar_School"> BGS wikipedia </a>
>The year that I graduated BGS was the same year that Apple released the ipod to the world. In that final year I went to the school career adviser and stated I had two passions... sports ( coaching/playing ) and IT/computing and wasnt sure which direction to take, I was advised to go with sport because there **"wasn't much of a future in IT"** ... in 2001. Good ol' BGS.

I worked in many positions around the UK and indeed the world, most notable are my time working my way up from croupier to pitboss in the casinos of Northern England, and my time as a shift manager / function manager of two historic hotels in Northern England.

Fast Forward a few years, and I found myself living and working in New Zealands central Otago region, world famous for its award winning wineries. I worked in a highly rated award winning Japanese restaurant and can say I truly reached the peak of my cheffing career at Millbrook.

I returned to Brno, Czech Republic from this experience, and became an English teacher to private Czech Students and companies. I was an Entrepeneur of all things!

Then I started thinking about IT....

### A bit about the present

I got my break in IT starting in a non-technical role for IBM. Co-ordinator work quickly showed itself as a non-challenge and not something I wanted to do for very long, a means to an end. It did however give me all the time I needed to study Linux basics, life would never be the same.

From my early days, struggling to understand ```cd``` and ```ls``` and my very first script...
```
#!/bin/bash
input=$1
cd $input
echo "you are now in $input, heres the contents.."
ls -l $input
exit
```
I knew that this was what I was here to do, whatever "this" was. I quickly became a sysadmin, patching and repairing security violations on \*nix and Solaris servers for IBM, offering support to one of the worlds biggest banking clients. For more info please see the 'online_cv' page. 

Fast forward just \_3_ very short years, and Im now a Quality Assurance Engineer in Red Hat, one of the IT worlds best and highly regarded open source companies. Im a middleware specialist mainly focussing on Enterprise messaging systems. Currently working on Enmasse (AMQ online), an Openshift based messaging application.I recently passed my RHCSA exam, and I'm learning more and more every day about Subsystem Messaging, Cloud infrastructure and Network Automation. Again, 3 years ago, I was a chef. (Im not bragging, I would like to offer some motivation... if you want to change your life, its possible :smile: )

IT areas I'm interested in, 

- RHCE and advanced linux
- Openshift Platform
- Ansible
- Docker and Container tech. in general
- Python, Java, Golang
- Git, Jenkins
- Advanced Networking concepts
- Ethical Hacking
- little bit of website design ( html / css / js / jekyll ) when I have time
- Collecting stickers for my laptop


In my spare time, I study the above subjects, I play guitar, I read and I ride my bike (if that sounds quite solitary, then so be it) When I do go out, I enjoy the fine restaurants and \<sarcasm\> friendly staff \</sarcasm\> of Brno's nicest bars with my friends ( there, not so solitary...) 
If youve never been to Brno, please do, its a beautiful place, with all the things an English guy needs to have a good time, I mean life.
